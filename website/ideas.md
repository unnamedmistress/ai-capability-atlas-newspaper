# Design Brainstorming for The AI Capability Atlas

**Design Movement**: Editorial Modernism (inspired by The Economist, The New York Times, The Guardian)

**Core Principles**:
1. **Typographic Authority**: Establish credibility through classic serif headlines paired with clean sans-serif body text
2. **Information Architecture**: Grid-based layouts that guide the eye through complex hierarchies
3. **Restrained Elegance**: Minimal color palette with strategic accent usage
4. **Data Visualization Excellence**: Infographics that inform without overwhelming

**Color Philosophy**: 
Neutral foundation (black #222, white #FFF, grays) with strategic accent colors that carry meaning—blue #0056B3 for primary actions and trust, teal #007A87 for secondary information, orange #D35400 for cognitive highlights. Colors are never decorative; they always serve a purpose.

**Layout Paradigm**: 
Newspaper-inspired multi-column grid system. Content flows in vertical columns with clear visual hierarchy. Asymmetric layouts for feature sections, symmetric grids for taxonomy displays. Generous whitespace creates breathing room between dense information blocks.

**Signature Elements**:
1. **Serif Headlines with Underlines**: Classic newspaper-style section dividers
2. **Infographic Cards**: Data visualizations presented as editorial graphics with clean borders
3. **Numbered Navigation**: Clear progression through complex information (1, 2, 3...)

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions should feel deliberate and informative. Hover states reveal additional context. Clicks navigate with purpose. No frivolous animations—only transitions that aid comprehension. Progressive disclosure prevents overwhelm.

**Animation**:
Subtle fade-ins for content loading. Smooth scrolling between sections. Gentle hover elevations on cards (2px → 8px shadow). No bouncing, spinning, or playful motion—maintain gravitas.

**Typography System**:
- Headlines: Georgia (serif) at 2.5rem, weight 700, line-height 1.2
- Subheads: Georgia at 2rem, weight 600
- Body: Inter (sans-serif) at 1rem, weight 400, line-height 1.6, max-width 70ch
- Labels: Inter at 0.875rem, weight 500
- Metadata: Inter at 0.75rem, weight 400, color #888

**Design Movement**: Swiss Rationalism meets Digital Brutalism

**Core Principles**:
1. **Systematic Precision**: Everything aligns to an 8px grid, no exceptions
2. **Functional Minimalism**: Every element serves a purpose, zero decoration
3. **Typographic Hierarchy**: Size, weight, and spacing create all visual hierarchy
4. **Honest Materials**: Exposed structure, visible grids, transparent processes

**Color Philosophy**:
Monochromatic base with single accent color. Black #000 on white #FFF for maximum contrast. Blue #0056B3 used sparingly for interactive elements only. Borders are always 1px solid black. Backgrounds are either pure white or 5% gray tint.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Strict modular grid with visible dividers. Content blocks are perfect rectangles. No rounded corners, no shadows—only hard edges and clean separations. Asymmetric compositions that break the grid intentionally for emphasis.

**Signature Elements**:
1. **Exposed Grid Lines**: Faint gray lines showing the underlying structure
2. **Monospace Numbers**: All numerical data in monospace font for alignment
3. **Bold Section Headers**: Uppercase, tracked-out, heavy weight dividers

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Instant feedback, no transitions. Clicks change state immediately. Hover states use only color inversion (black ↔ white). Navigation is always visible and unambiguous. Users should never wonder where they are.

**Animation**:
None. State changes are instant. If transition is necessary, use 100ms linear fade—nothing longer.

**Typography System**:
- Headlines: Helvetica Neue at 3rem, weight 700, uppercase, letter-spacing 0.05em
- Body: Helvetica Neue at 1rem, weight 400, line-height 1.5
- Code/Data: IBM Plex Mono at 0.875rem
- All text is either black or blue, no grays

**Design Movement**: Academic Journal meets Information Design

**Core Principles**:
1. **Scholarly Depth**: Dense information presented with clarity through layered hierarchy
2. **Reference-Driven**: Citations, footnotes, and cross-references are first-class design elements
3. **Diagrammatic Thinking**: Complex ideas visualized through custom diagrams and charts
4. **Timeless Aesthetics**: Design that could work in print or digital, 1990 or 2030

**Color Philosophy**:
Warm neutrals (cream #F9F9F9, charcoal #222) with muted academic accent colors—burgundy #8B2635 for emphasis, forest green #2D5016 for success states, navy #1B3A5F for links. Colors feel aged and authoritative, never bright or saturated.

**Layout Paradigm**:
Two-column layout inspired by academic journals. Main content in wider left column (60%), supplementary information in narrower right column (35%), 5% gutter. Footnotes and references appear in margins. Full-width sections for major transitions.

**Signature Elements**:
1. **Marginal Annotations**: Side notes, definitions, and cross-references in the margin
2. **Figure Captions**: Detailed captions below all visualizations with "Figure 1.2" numbering
3. **Section Numbering**: Hierarchical numbering system (1.0, 1.1, 1.1.1) throughout

**Interaction Philosophy**:
Interactions reveal deeper layers of information. Hover on terms shows definitions. Click on citations opens references panel. Expandable sections for detailed explanations. Reading experience is paramount—interactions support comprehension.

**Animation**:
Gentle, purposeful transitions. Content fades in with slight upward movement (10px). Panels slide in from right (300ms ease-out). Diagrams draw in progressively. All animation serves to guide attention.

**Typography System**:
- Headlines: Merriweather (serif) at 2.25rem, weight 700, line-height 1.3
- Body: Source Serif Pro at 1.125rem, weight 400, line-height 1.7, justified
- Captions: Source Sans Pro at 0.875rem, weight 400, italic
- Marginal Notes: Source Sans Pro at 0.8125rem, weight 400
- Code: Source Code Pro at 0.9375rem
