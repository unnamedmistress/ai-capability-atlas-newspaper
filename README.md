# The AI Capability Atlas

An investigative interactive digital newspaper answering: **What can AI actually do for everyday people?**

## About This Project

This is a serious digital publication built through adversarial multi-agent refinement. It explores AI capabilities from a human-centered, non-technical perspective, focusing on structured thinking skills rather than prompt formulas.

## Current Status (Round 0 Complete)

**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-16  
**Progress**: Round 0 of 9 completed

### What's Included:
- ✅ Initial 4+ layer capability taxonomy (5 domains, 7 capabilities)
- ✅ Decision tree for problem-to-capability mapping
- ✅ Cognitive model with mental models and skill ladder
- ✅ React static site with newspaper aesthetic
- ✅ Documentation (process log, changelog, sources)
- ✅ GitHub repository with automatic deployment setup

### Next Rounds (Planned):
1. **Adversarial critique** - Identify weak categories and redundancies
2. **Cognitive integration** - Educational psychology framing
3. **Decision engine refinement** - Interactive branching logic
4. **Visual design** - Newspaper infographics and styling
5. **Investigative articles** - Long-form editorial content
6. **Final publication** - Enhanced interactivity and deployment

## Core Sections

1. **Front Page** - Introduction and overview
2. **Capability Taxonomy** - Interactive exploration of AI capabilities (4+ layers)
3. **Decision Engine** - Branching wizard for problem-to-capability mapping
4. **Decomposition Lab** - Step-by-step problem breakdown trainer
5. **Cognitive Model** - Skill ladder and mental models for AI use
6. **Field Experiments** - Clickable micro-experiments and prompt drills
7. **Investigative Articles** - Long-form editorial pieces on AI literacy

## Key Principles

- **No APIs, coding, or special access required** for end users
- **Focus on structured thinking**, not feature memorization
- **Reduce overwhelm**, build experimentation confidence
- **Teach problem decomposition** as core skill
- **Serious investigative journalism** tone

## Technology

Built as a static site with:
- React + Vite for interactivity
- Client-side only, no backend
- GitHub Pages deployment
- Newspaper aesthetic design

## Development

3. Educational Psychologist
4. Use Case Designer
5. Decision Architect
6. Visual Systems Designer
7. Interaction Designer
8. Investigative Editor
9. Repo Publisher
