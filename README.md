# The AI Capability Atlas

**An investigative interactive digital newspaper answering: What can AI actually do for everyday people?**

🔗 **Live Site**: [View the Atlas](https://unnamedmistress.github.io/ai-capability-atlas-newspaper/)

## About This Project

This is a serious digital publication built through adversarial multi-agent refinement using the OpenClaw orchestration framework. It explores AI capabilities from a human-centered, non-technical perspective, focusing on structured thinking skills rather than prompt formulas.

## Current Status

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-18  
**Progress**: OpenClaw Orchestration Complete (Phases 0-8)

### ✅ Completed

- **6-layer capability taxonomy** (4 domains, 13 categories, 71 capabilities, 150+ use cases)
- **Cognitive model** with skill ladder (Novice → Competent → Proficient)
- **Decision tree v2** for problem-to-capability mapping
- **4 investigative articles** (7,247 words total)
- **9 generated infographics** (newspaper aesthetic)
- **React + Vite static site** with interactive components
- **2 rounds of Level 4 adversarial critique**
- **Complete process documentation**

## Core Sections

1. **Front Page** - Introduction and key infographics
2. **Capability Taxonomy** - Interactive 6-layer exploration of AI capabilities
3. **Decision Engine** - Branching wizard for problem-to-capability mapping
4. **Decomposition Lab** - Step-by-step problem breakdown trainer
5. **Cognitive Model** - Skill ladder, mental models, and thinking lenses
6. **Field Experiments** - Interactive micro-experiments and prompt drills
7. **Investigative Articles** - Long-form editorial journalism

## Investigative Articles

- **Why People Don't Know What AI Can Do** (1,829 words)
- **The Skill Gap Isn't Prompting — It's Thinking** (1,865 words)
- **AI as Cognitive Amplifier, Not Replacement** (1,687 words)
- **From Overwhelm to Decomposition** (1,866 words)

## Key Principles

- **No APIs, coding, or special access required** for end users
- **Focus on structured thinking**, not feature memorization
- **Reduce overwhelm**, build experimentation confidence
- **Teach problem decomposition** as core skill
- **Serious investigative journalism** tone

## Technology

Built as a static site with:
- React + Vite for interactivity
- Client-side only, no backend
- GitHub Pages deployment
- Newspaper aesthetic design

## OpenClaw Orchestration

This project was created through a 9-phase adversarial refinement process:

**Phases 0-5 (Feb 16):**
0. Project Setup & Requirements
1. Initial Architecture (Content Architect)
2. Adversarial Critique Round 1 (Skeptical Analyst - Level 4)
3. Revision & Refinement (Content Architect)
4. Cognitive Optimization (Educational Psychologist)
5. Decision & Navigation Design (Decision Architect)

**Phases 6-8 (Feb 18):**
6. Adversarial Critique Round 2 (Skeptical Analyst - Level 4)
7. Visual & Interaction Design (Visual Systems Designer + Interaction Designer)
8. Content Creation (Investigative Editor)
